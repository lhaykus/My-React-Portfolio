## Description
I used React and Material UI to build a responsive, unique, interactive portfolio to showcase my coding projects! 
- [X] <span style='color:#0FB3EE; font-weight:bold'>React Parallax</span> was used to create a fun background that 'moves' when scrolling
- [X] <span style='color:#0FB3EE; font-weight:bold'>React Typed </span> was used to create a fun animation for text that makes words look like they are being typed and erased on the page.
- [X] <span style='color:#0FB3EE; font-weight:bold'>React Card Flip </span> was used for my project page. The front side is a picture of the app with some deployment links and the title. When you click the 'Click for more info' button, the card is turned around to the other side that has a decription of the app and a GIF is seen.
